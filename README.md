Let Tater optimize your game! It may be more potato than vanilla when it is done!

## About Potatoptimize
This is an **experimental** optimization mod that pools some optimizations from PaperMC as well as my own optimizations. 
While the majority of the optimizations are for servers, all the server optimizations can apply to the client in singleplayer.
This mod *does not* intend to respect vanilla parity, however in general the differences with and without this mod are very minor. 

## Here be taters!
This mod is very early in development. Expect bugs and report bugs, please and thanks. The only way giant mods like this can be improved is from the support of the community and testers. If you find a bug, please report it on the Github Issue Tracker.

## Can I have it on (Neo)Forge?
Hmm... we'll see, but tater doesn't like Forge.
