Let Tater optimize your game! It may be more potato than vanilla when it is done!

## About Potatoptimize
This is an optimization mod that pools some optimizations from PaperMC as well as my own optimizations. 
While the majority of the optimizations are for servers, all the server optimizations can apply to the client in singleplayer.
Most optimizations are niche changes that no other large optimization mod covers.
This mod *does not* intend to respect vanilla parity. Optimizations that do respect vanilla parity are listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/Tater-Certified/Potatoptimize/wiki/Configuration-File).


## But I play on <insert mod loader>, can I use it?
The chances are good, probably yes! This mod supports Fabric, Quilt, Forge, NeoForge, and Sponge!
PaperMC (and forks) support is unlikely to happen since this mod borrows patches from those projects.
